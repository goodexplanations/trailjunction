    <h2 class="sub-heading">💡 The Idea</h2>
    <p> Website which fundamentally has: a map view with each location of a trail run plotted on it. (Later version, when you zoom in, see actual trail that you run on)

        Then some sliders: date, distance and a quick select for a province, slider for entry price, multi-day or not, etc. 
        
        A different version of this could be for places to run, not necessarily races: 

        <ul>
            <li>At first glance it should show Distance, Elevation, Terrain and Saffer Trails Score</li>
            <li>Sliders would be access: public, paid, private</li>
            <li>Links out to Event Pages etc.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2 class="sub-heading">Features to Build</h2>

    <p>Extra features that could be added:
    
    <li>Ability to connect your strata and it gives you an estimated time</li>
    <li>Monetise by linking to websites</li>
    <li>You can enter your location and it gives “distance from you” - similar to AutoTrader for car sales</li>
    <li>“Need someone to go with?” - refer to a trail guide</li>
    <li>User login, that’s a whole new universe</li>
